# To include an endpoint that isn't a part of your Laravel app (or belongs to a vendor package),
# you can define it in a custom.*.yaml file, like this one.
# Each custom file should contain an array of endpoints. Here's an example:
# See https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/documenting/custom-endpoints#extra-sorting-groups-in-custom-endpoint-files for more options

#- httpMethods:
#    - POST
#  uri: api/doSomething/{param}
#  metadata:
#    groupName: The group the endpoint belongs to. Can be a new group or an existing group.
#    groupDescription: A description for the group. You don't need to set this for every endpoint; once is enough.
#    subgroup: You can add a subgroup, too.
#    title: Do something
#    description: 'This endpoint allows you to do something.'
#    authenticated: false
#  headers:
#    Content-Type: application/json
#    Accept: application/json
#  urlParameters:
